# Preliminary-Test-
ARCHITECTURE AND TECHNICAL CHOICE
As the architecture is the building block of any project.It is the base foundation for developing the project.So,I have used the languages which are easy to understand and the preliminary to bulid the project and with the coming future I would make the changes easily.This is so Also,this language has multiple features with it which is helpful for me to devlop my projects.
As a technical choice this is the best language I choosed because in the coming future I can build or innovate my projects with the previous one made.In future I could add more prefered frontend languages and can build the backend of the same project.So,this can be very vast in upcoming time.
